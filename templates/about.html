    <h3>The Web-App</h3>
    <p>
        I am building this web-app to expand my programming skills and knowledge,
        more specifically about APIs (Application Programming Interface).
    </p>
    <p>
        Throughout this journey, I will share the key takeaways so they may help
        other people in their learning path.
    </p>
    <p>
        This website has no commercial purposes.

    <h4>Revision 0.1</h4>
    <p>
        Learned how this specific API expects the query requests messages to be written
        so the engine can understand and process it. Understood how the replies are structured
        and translated the API engine answer into readable data.
